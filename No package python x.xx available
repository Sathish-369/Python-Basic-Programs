How to install python version which is not availble on the deafult repo:
Error:
No package python x.xx available.
Error: Nothing to do


To install python version which we requiered on our os first we have to install pyenv and using it to install Python x.xx.xx:

    Install pyenv:


curl https://pyenv.run | bash

Add pyenv to your shell's initialization file (e.g., .bashrc, .bash_profile, .zshrc):
Open ~/.bashrc:
vi ~/.bashrc

Add the line to the end of the text file:

echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.pyenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'eval "$(pyenv init --path)"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

Save it:
:wq
and run the following command:
source ~/.bashrc

After the above run the following line:


sudo yum install -y gcc zlib-devel bzip2 bzip2-devel readline-devel sqlite sqlite-devel openssl-devel tk-devel libffi-devel xz-devel


then install the python version 

pyenv install x.xx.xx

Set Python xx.xx for your project directory:

pyenv global xx.xx.0

Now you should have Python xx.xx installed and set as your active Python version. 

Check the version now:

python --version
